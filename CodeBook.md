## CodeBook

The variables in the tidy data are as follows:

 * subject_id - The id of the experiment participant
 * activity_name - the name of the activity that was measured

The following variables aare the mean of all observation mean measurements denoted with names that contain mean() and standard deviation measurements denoted with names that contain std() for each activity and each subject.

 * tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
 * tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
