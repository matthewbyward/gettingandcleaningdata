# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository contains the files necessary to perform analysis on data generated by an experiment using a Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone

### Repository Contents

* `README.md`
* `CodeBook.md`
* `run_analysis.R`

In addition, a tidy dataset that was generated by `run_analysis.R` has also been included names `tidy_data.txt`


### Generating the Tidy Data

1.  Download the experiment data from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2.  Unzip the data into the same folder that has the `run_analysis.R` script in it
3.  The folder `UCI HAR Dataset` will be the result of the unzipping process, which should also be in the same directory as the `run_analysis.R` script
4.  Review the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and code comments in [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) to familiarize oneself with how the experiment data is being processed
5.  Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
6.  Review the script output which is written to the file `tidy_data.txt`
